# Multi-task Learning for Predicting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Progression

The main objective is to investigate multi task learning approaches into predicting Alzheimer's disease progression measured by the cognitive scores and selecting biomarkers predictive of the progression with good accuracy.
In order to achieve good accuracy, we investigate four different objective funcytions namely ridge regression, lasso regression, multi task lasso regression and temporal group lasso regression to optimize the learning models.
